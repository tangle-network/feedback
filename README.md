These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community.

The Issues feature of this repository has been disabled. Discussion categories have been established for specific parts of the Webb ecosystem listed above, as well as a general category for other topics. Additional categories may be added in the future. In the meantime, topics outside of the listed categories above, will be transferred into the general category.

## Asking a question

Search, and research. Please do your own due diligence in researching for a potential solution before posting. Be sure to review previous questions related to your topic which may provide the answer to your problem. Write a title that summarizes the specific problem.  
## Answering a question

Thanks for taking the time to contribute an answer. It‚Äôs because of helpful peers like yourself that we‚Äôre able to learn together as a community. 

Read the question carefully. What, specifically, is the question asking for? Make sure your answer provides that ‚Äì or a viable alternative. The answer can be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that‚Äù, but it should also include ‚Äútry this instead‚Äù. Any answer that gets the asker going in the right direction is helpful, but do try to mention any limitations, assumptions or simplifications in your answer. Brevity is acceptable, but fuller explanations are better. Provide relevant links and context where applicable.

Always be polite and appreciative!

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/webb-tools/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.
